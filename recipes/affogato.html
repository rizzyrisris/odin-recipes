    <h3>Description</h3>
    <div class="section">
        <p>When I was at Journey's Cafe at One Lake, I was craving some coffee milkshake but they ran out coffee ice cream and the employee suggested I try Affogato. I honestly didn't know what it was but since they said it had ice cream and coffee, I said I'll get one. Whoever invented this is a genius. Hope you will like it as much as I do.</p>
