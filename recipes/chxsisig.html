    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <div class="section">
        <ol>
            <li>Place sizzling metal plate in a 450 F oven for about 10 minutes to preheat. </li>
            <li>In a wide pan over medium-high heat, heat 1 tablespoon of the oil. Add garlic and cook until softened.</li>
            <li>Add chopped chicken and spread across the surface of the pan. Cook, turning on sides as needed, for about 2 to 3 minutes or until lightly brown and begins to crisp.</li>
            <li>Add soy sauce and continue to cook, stirring as needed, for another 30 to 40 seconds or until sauce is mostly absorbed.</li>
            <li>In a pan over medium heat, heat the remaining oil until hot. Gently add chicken livers and cook, turning as needed, until crispy and fully cooked.</li>
            <li>With a slotted spoon, remove from pan and drain on paper towels. Let cool to touch and chop.</li>
            <li>In a large bowl, combine chicken, liver, onions, chili peppers, and calamansi juice.</li>
            <li>Add mayonnaise and stir until well-combined. Season with salt and pepper to taste.</li>
            <li>Carefully place the preheated sizzle metal plate on the wood bottom.</li>
            <li>Transfer chicken mixture onto sizzle plate and garnish with additional chopped or sliced chili peppers if desired. Serve immediately.</li>
