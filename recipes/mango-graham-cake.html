    <h3>Description</h3>
    <div class="section">
        <p>Do you like mangoes? What about graham crackers? Well if you like both then you'll definitely love this Filipino dessert. This recipe is for people with a sweet tooth like me!</p>
    </div>
    <h3>Ingridients</h3>
    <div class="section">
        <ul>
            <li>2 cups heavy cream</li>
            <li>2-4 tbsp condensed milk to taste</li>
            <li>Graham crackers</li>
            <li>flesh from 3-4 ripe mangoes cubed</li>
        </ul>
    </div>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <div class="section">
        <ol>
            <li>Using a handheld electric mixer or a stand mixer fitted with the whisk attachment, whip 2 cups of heavy cream on medium-high speed until soft-medium peaks.</li>
            <li>Switch to low-medium speed and drizzle the condensed milk a little at a time. Add more until you get the sweetness you want. Once you're satisfied, switch back to medium-high speed and beat until smooth and stiff.</li>
            <li>Place a layer of graham crackers at the bottom of a deep 8Ã—8 baking dish. Evenly spread a heaping cup of cream on top of your graham crackers. Then put a layer of diced mangoes on top of that.</li>
            <li>Repeat by covering the mangoes with graham cracker cookies. Be sure to cover the entire layer; cut the cookies to fit. Then cover with another layer of cream and top with more mangoes.</li>
            <li>You now have two options: you can either (1) freeze or (2) chill the cake in the fridge overnight. Freezing will result to a more ice cream cake-like end product which you would have to thaw several minutes before serving. Chilling will result to a creamy, ready-to-eat cake out of the fridge.</li>
        </ol>
